# {rmsSampling}

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of {rmsSampling} is to ease the implementation of the RMS Sampling guidance

User are guided through a workflow:
 * Select the country so that the last population statistics aggregated by group are pulled
     * RAS  - aka REF+ASY+OIP, Refugees, Asylum-seeker and other in     Need of International Protection -  "Pillar-1-Refugee"
     * STA: Stateless Persons --  "Pillar-2-Stateless"
     * IDP: Internally displaced Persons   -  "Pillar-4-IDP" 
     * REP (RET+ROC): Returned Refugees & IDPs - "Pillar-3-Reintegration"    
     * OOC: Other of Concerns        
 
Then for each group a specific tab will be available with a series of conditional questions to confirm wether one the 7 potential sampling method can apply: 
 * Flag population groups with less than 5,000 individuals, to confirm if there is really budget to implement a sampling strategy
 * Request user to  indicate if a reliable registration group list is available for each population group
 * Check size of the country to confirm if the implementation area is small (allowing for __Simple Random Sampling without stratification__)
 * Check if disaggregation by geographic location are available within the countries  (allowing for __Simple Random Sampling within strata__)
 * Check breakdown by country of Origin to confirm if potential stratification by country of orgin would make sense for Refugee and Asylum Seekers? (allowing for __multiple Stage Cluster Sampling__)
 * Check if budget and time is available to conduct a list exercise (allowing for either __Probability Proportion to Size__ or __Adaptive Cluster Sampling__)
 * Check if the population tend to gather to a certain location on a specific day time? (allowing for a __Location Time Sampling__)
 * Check if the community if well connected and is there is adequate time to conduct a formative survey to identify the sees and prepare coupons? (allowing for a __Respondent Driven Sampling__)
 * ask for expected margin of errors, level of confidence and sample power.
 
 As an output they can generate a report to document the appropriate sampling approach by country.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rmsSampling like so:

``` r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("edouard-legoupil/msSampling")  
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rmsSampling)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
